\noindent \textbf{\underline{WORK EXPERIENCE}} \\
\noindent \textbf{NVIDIA} \hfill Santa Clara, California\\
\textit{Software Engineering Intern} \hfill May 2022 $-$ August 2022
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
	\item Researched different rate limiting designs for Unified Access Management (UAM) service (which will handle authorization for all Nvidia's cloud services) and implemented a global rate limiting solution which used Lyft's open source ratelimit service and Redis. This was a critical requirement for scaling the UAM service. 
	\item Analyzed response time of the rate limiting service and optimized connection parameters to the service to reduce latency and satisfy SLA's. Final latency: p95 was 15ms
	\item Designed and implemented APIs to dynamically change the global ratelimit configuration with zero downtime with 95\% unit test coverage.
	\item Read Designing Data-Intensive Applications, which helped me understand intricacies of distributed systems and make better design choices (for e.g. choices involving trade-offs between availability and consistency)
	\item Technologies/Skills: Go, go-kit, testify, Envoy, AWS, Kubernetes, Redis, Terraform, Cassandra, Distributed Systems \\
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Texas A\&M University} \hfill College Station, Texas, USA\\
\textit{Graduate Research Assistant (Conversational AI Developer) - Soft Research Lab} \hfill January 2022 $-$ May 2022
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Led a team of 2 to add conversational intelligence to VR characters in different VR applications like \href{https://softinteraction.com/portfolio/sbirt-vr}{SBIRT-VR}}.
\item {Developed, deployed and maintained a conversational ML model which exhibited different patient personalities that students used to practice their diagnostic skills.}
\item Technologies: Rasa, Python, Flask, Gunicorn, PyTorch, BERT and its variants, Scikit-Learn\\

\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Citrix R\&D} \hfill Bangalore, Karnataka, India \\
\textit{Software Development Engineer 2} \hfill April 2021 $-$ August 2021 \\
\textit{Software Development Engineer} \hfill July 2019 $-$ March 2021 \\
\textit{Software Development Intern} \hfill January 2019 $-$ June 2019
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Designed and implemented cloud modules for Azure and GCP for High Availability and Backend Autoscaling features in Citrix's Application Delivery Controller (ADC). These features increased the adoption of the product by around 20\%.}
\item {Proposed and led an initiative to create a unified API for communicating with different cloud providers that made development of new features of Citrix ADC 3 times faster on these clouds.}
\item {Recognized that existing library used for testing Citrix ADC (built in-house) was not suitable to test cloud specific features (only black box testing was being done). Started a new initiative to add unit tests by mocking cloud services.}
\item {Developed a new framework to automate the deployment of complex network configurations using Citrix ADC on different clouds like GCP, AWS, and Azure, which reduced the average testing time for new releases of the product by around 60\%. Won `Highest Revenue Impact' and `Most Popular Choice' awards at Citrix's Techfair (2019) for this project.}
\item {Technologies: AWS, Azure, GCP, Python, C, Ansible\\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Samsung R\&D} \hfill Bangalore, Karnataka, India \\
\textit{Software Development Intern} \hfill June 2018 $-$ August 2018
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Co-led a team of 4 to create an ML model by experimenting with different unsupervised clustering algorithms like DBSCAN, K-MEANS, and OPTICS to identify under-performing eNodeBs in a highly overloaded LTE network using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which entirely eliminated manual supervision to detect congested eNodeBs.}
\item{Technologies: R, DBSCAN, K-MEANS, OPTICS.\\}
