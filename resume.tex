\noindent \textbf{Citrix R\&D} \hfill Bangalore, Karnataka, India \\
\textit{Software Development Engineer 2} \hfill April, 2021 $-$ August, 2021 \\
\textit{Software Development Engineer} \hfill July, 2019 $-$ March, 2021 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Collaborated with 7 people across 3 countries (India, Greece and US) to implement High Avaliability and Backend Autoscaling in Citrix's Application Delivery Controller (ADC) for different cloud providers: AWS, Azure and GCP, which increased the adoption of the product by around 20\% on all the cloud providers.}
\item {Proposed and led an initiative to create an unified API for communicating with different cloud providers that made development of new features of Citrix ADC 3 times faster on these clouds. \\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Citrix R\&D} \hfill Bangalore, Karnataka, India \\
\textit{Software Development Intern} \hfill January, 2019 $-$ June, 2019
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Developed a new framework to automate the deployment of complex topologies using Citrix ADC on different clouds like GCP, AWS, and Azure, which reduced the average testing time for new releases of the product by around 60\%. My team won Highest Revenue Impact’ and ‘Most Popular Choice’ awards at Citrix's Techfair (2019) for this project.\\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Samsung R\&D} \hfill Bangalore, Karnataka, India \\
\textit{Software Development Intern} \hfill June, 2018 $-$ August, 2018
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Co-led a team of 4 to create a ML model by experimenting with different unsupervised clustering algorithms like DBSCAN, K-MEANS, and OPTICS to identify under-performing eNodeBs in a highly overloaded LTE network using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which entirely eliminated manual supervision to detect congested eNodeBs. \\}

\noindent \textbf{\underline{UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC PROJECTS}} \\
\noindent \textbf{Gesture Recognition using SVC (\url{https://git.io/JG4Si})} 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Created a ML model using SVM with Gaussian Kernel which could recognize gestures from American Sign Language with about 91\% accuracy. \\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Classification of Book Genres using Book Cover and Title (\url{https://git.io/JG49J})} 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Collaborated with 3 people to create a ML model using Xception to extract cover features, GloVe to extract title features and a logistic classifier that combined these features and classified the books into one of the genres. Final accuracy obtained was approximately 87\%.}
\item {Presented a paper on this at \textit{IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Green Technology}\\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Distributed Downloading (\url{https://git.io/JG49l})} 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Used a primary secondary architecture to equally distribute the downloading of a file among all participating devices (\textit{n}), which sped up the download by a factor of \textit{n}. \\}
