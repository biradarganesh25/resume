\noindent \textbf{\underline{WORK EXPERIENCE}} \\
\noindent \textbf{NVIDIA} \hfill Santa Clara, California\\
\textit{Software Engineering Intern \hfill May, 2022 $-$ Present}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
	\item Researched different possible rate limiting designs for Unified Access Management (UAM) service (which handles authorization for all Nvidia services) and implemented a global rate limiting solution which used Envoy's ratelimit service and Redis. This was a critical requirement for scaling the UAM service. Deployed on AWS in a Kubertenes cluster.
	\item Analyzed response time of the rate limiting service across differnet types of traffic and optmized different modules like the log exporter to improve the latency.\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Texas A\&M University} \hfill College Station, Texas, USA\\
\textit{Graduate Research Assistant (Conversational AI Developer) - Soft Research Lab \hfill January, 2022 $-$ Present}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Leading a team of 2 to add conversational intelligence to VR characters in different VR applications like \href{https://softinteraction.com/portfolio/sbirt-vr}{SBIRT-VR}}.\\
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Citrix R\&D} \hfill Bangalore, Karnataka, India \\
\textit{Software Development Engineer 2} \hfill April, 2021 $-$ August, 2021 \\
\textit{Software Development Engineer} \hfill July, 2019 $-$ March, 2021 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Collaborated with 7 people across 3 countries (India, Greece and US) to implement High Availability and Backend Autoscaling in Citrix's Application Delivery Controller (ADC) for different cloud providers: AWS, Azure and GCP, which increased the adoption of the product by around 20\% on all the cloud providers.}
\item {Proposed and led an initiative to create an unified API for communicating with different cloud providers that made development of new features of Citrix ADC 3 times faster on these clouds. }
\item {Played a key role in migrating the ADC codebase from FreeBSD 8.4 to 11.4\\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Citrix R\&D} \hfill Bangalore, Karnataka, India \\
\textit{Software Development Intern} \hfill January, 2019 $-$ June, 2019
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Developed a new framework to automate the deployment of complex topologies using Citrix ADC on different clouds like GCP, AWS, and Azure, which reduced the average testing time for new releases of the product by around 60\%. My team won Highest Revenue Impact’ and ‘Most Popular Choice’ awards at Citrix's Techfair (2019) for this project.\\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Samsung R\&D} \hfill Bangalore, Karnataka, India \\
\textit{Software Development Intern} \hfill June, 2018 $-$ August, 2018
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Co-led a team of 4 to create a ML model by experimenting with different unsupervised clustering algorithms like DBSCAN, K-MEANS, and OPTICS to identify under-performing eNodeBs in a highly overloaded LTE network using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which entirely eliminated manual supervision to detect congested eNodeBs. \\}
\end{itemize}
