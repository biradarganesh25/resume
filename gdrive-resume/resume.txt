**WORK EXPERIENCE**

**Texas A&M University, College Station *Graduate Research Assistant*
July 2020 – June 2021**

-   Leading a team of 2 to add conversational intelligence to VR
    characters in different VR applications

**Citrix R&D, Bangalore *Software Engineer 2* April 2019 – August 2019**

-   Collaborated with 7 people across 3 countries to implement High
    Availability and Backend Autoscaling in Citrix's ADC for different
    cloud providers: AWS, Azure and GCP, which increased the adoption of
    the product by around 20%

-   Proposed and led an initiative to create an unified API for
    communicating with different cloud providers that made development
    of new features of Citrix ADC 3 times faster on these clouds

-   Played a key role in migrating the ADC codebase from FreeBSD 8.4 to
    11.4

**Citrix R&D , Bangalore *Software Engineering Intern* May 2018 – July
2018**

-   Developed a new framework to automate the deployment of complex
    topologies using Citrix ADC on different clouds like GCP, AWS, and
    Azure, which reduced the average testing time for new releases of
    the product by around 60%.

-   My team won Highest Revenue Impact’ and ‘Most Popular Choice’ awards
    at Citrix's Techfair (2019) for this project

**Samsung R&D, Bangalore *Software Engineering Intern* June 2018 –
August 2019**

-   Co-led a team of 4 to to identify under-performing eNodeBs using
    > unsupervised clustering algorithms in a highly overloaded LTE
    > network, which entirely eliminated manual supervision to detect
    > congested eNodeBs

**PROJECTS **

**Parallized Gaussian Process Regression using CUDA **

-   Parallized different steps involved such as LU decomposition, matrix
    multiplication and achieved a peak speedup of over 200 for the
    decompose function

**Parallel matrix inversion of upper triangular matrix using OpenMP **

-   Achieved a speedup of around 4 using by parallelizing the recursive
    implementation

**Distributed In-Memory Key-Value Storage**

-   Used a main server to keep track of partitions of key across
    multiple servers, which is used to redirect queries. Static
    partitioning of keys is decided based on the number of server

**Apriori on Spark**

-   Implemented apriori algorithm as part of a data-flow processing
    > system to detect relationships between itemsets
